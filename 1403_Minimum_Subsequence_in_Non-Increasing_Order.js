// Given the array nums, obtain a subsequence of the array whose sum of elements is strictly greater than the sum of the non included elements in such subsequence. 

// If there are multiple solutions, return the subsequence with minimum size and if there still exist multiple solutions, return the subsequence with the maximum total sum of all its elements. A subsequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array. 

// Note that the solution with the given constraints is guaranteed to be unique. Also return the answer sorted in non-increasing order.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [4,3,10,9,8]
// Output: [10,9] 
// Explanation: The subsequences [10,9] and [10,8] are minimal such that the sum of their elements is strictly greater than the sum of elements not included, however, the subsequence [10,9] has the maximum total sum of its elements. 
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [4,4,7,6,7]
// Output: [7,7,6] 
// Explanation: The subsequence [7,7] has the sum of its elements equal to 14 which is not strictly greater than the sum of elements not included (14 = 4 + 4 + 6). Therefore, the subsequence [7,6,7] is the minimal satisfying the conditions. Note the subsequence has to returned in non-decreasing order.  
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [6]
// Output: [6]
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 500
// 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
