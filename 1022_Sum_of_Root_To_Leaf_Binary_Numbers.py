# You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.

# For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.

# Return the sum of these numbers. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bits integer.

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# Node.val is 0 or 1.


# Definition for a binary tree node.

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
